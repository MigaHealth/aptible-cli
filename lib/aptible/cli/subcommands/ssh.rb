              # SSH's default behavior is as follows:
              #
              # - If a TTY is forced, one is allocated.
              # - If there is no command, then a TTY is allocated.
              # - If no-TTY is forced, then none is allocated.
              # - No TTY is allocated if stdin isn't a TTY.
              #
              # Unfortunately, in our case, this breaks, because we use a
              # forced-command, so we don't *ever* send a command, which causes
              # SSH to *always* allocate TTY, which causes a variety of
              # problems, not least of which is that stdout and stderr end up
              # merged.
              #
              # Now, it's pretty common for Aptible users to run commands in
              # their container with the intention of using a TTY (by e.g.
              # running `aptible ssh bash`), so we use a slightly different
              # heuristic from SSH: we allocate TTY iif there's no input or
              # output redirection going on.
              #
              # End users can always override this behavior with the
              # --force-tty option.
